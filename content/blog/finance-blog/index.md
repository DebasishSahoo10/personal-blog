### Pushing the start button
The first step into the Finance Industry is to know Accounting and Stock Market at a moderate level. For accounting you need books and a lot of practice (that is why MBA in Finance has been easier for commerce graduates). But those who were not into commerce, you can still do it like anyone - Basic accounting Books is the way for you.  And if you are someone like me who prefer hours of video content instead of books Manoj Rajgopal Sir’s  old YT videos are a great go ( I will give links to every channel at the end of the page). You can give a try to books of Dr. Anil Lamba - they are also equally good.

For Stock Market Rachana Ranade Mam’s courses are a must for any beginner. Yes, there are other cheap courses also but hers is the explained in the best way possible. Form a group of friends and then take the course - cost will be reduced to per head. In her courses - you need to take up three things -

- Basics of stock market
- Fundamental Analysis
- Technical Analysis

Once these are done you are all suit up to take your Finance Journey into the next level and deep into core subjects.

### Why we do Git Branching
Git branching is a way to make changes to the existing code without affecting (or crashing mostly) the product that has been made with that code. Lets understand it with a example - while you are reading this part of the blog I made some changes in the main branch code, then the site will change itself while you are reading it. This is why we create a branch and confirm the code changes first and then merge it to the main branch.

### Some lesser known Git commands
