### Writing good commit messages
I have been doing community building on telegram for years now and been maintaining Android device communities. And through that I have got a good chance to review Git profiles of other devs and seen changelogs for thousands time. Now these things are helping me write good commit messages. *(writing good commit messages is as important as writing good code)*

### Why we do Git Branching
Git branching is a way to make changes to the existing code without affecting (or crashing mostly) the product that has been made with that code. Lets understand it with a example - while you are reading this part of the blog I made some changes in the main branch code, then the site will change itself while you are reading it. This is why we create a branch and confirm the code changes first and then merge it to the main branch.

### Some lesser known Git commands
    - git please
    - git commend
