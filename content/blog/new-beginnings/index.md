## Feed suggestion helps
One day I was surfing my twitter and catching the geopolitical news as 
I have a good intrest in them. I saw one tweet from Tanay Pratap in my 
feed. He twitted something about web devloping. I went ahead and surfed
his twitter profile a bit and gave him a follow (at that time I had no idea
that this man is going to be my coding mentor).
## Got nod from a Familiar name
Later that day I was watching a stream of Prakhar Gupta and someone in his
chat asked him about a coding question and he replied
> "Man I have no idea about it. You should go and ask Tanay Pratap about
>  it. He is the perfect person to answer this"

and I am someone who belives that Prakhar Gupta's words are worth a follow.
That is how my brain got a confirmation that Tanay Pratap is great at whatever
he does. Then I started reading and liking more tweets from Tanay Pratap.
> At that moment I had no idea that Tanay Pratap is just not great but he is
> the mahendra singh dhoni of it.

## My twitter got developer-fied 
Slowly my feed started getting tweets from more and more developers and 
I kinda liked the language they were using to put their development brain
out. Then I got to know about *neoGcamp* and *roc8* and read a lot people who 
got great results out of them. This got me more intrested into coding world.
I went ahead with all my curiosity and researched all about it and got all the 
details and doubt cleared.

## And here I am
Cut to December 2021 I decided to start *level zero* of *neoGcamp* but due to my 
exams it got postponed to Feb 2022 and **here I am on third lecture of level one.** *(to tell you guys a secret : I am loving it)*
